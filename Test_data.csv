Question,Answer
What are the main building blocks of life?,"The main building blocks of life are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These elements form carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids."
Why is water considered essential for life?,"Water is essential for life because it is a universal solvent, has high heat capacity, and provides a medium for chemical reactions. Its ability to form hydrogen bonds is critical for cellular functions."
"What are macromolecules, and why are they important?","Macromolecules are large molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, that are essential for life. They serve as energy sources, structural components, and functional molecules for biological processes."
How do ionic bonds form?,"Ionic bonds form when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions that are attracted to each other."
What is the role of enzymes in biological systems?,Enzymes act as biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for reactions to occur.
What are the properties of water that make it unique?,"Water has unique properties such as cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, and the ability to dissolve many substances, making it essential for life."
What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?,"Saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms, making them solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds, making them liquid at room temperature."
"What are nucleotides, and why are they important?","Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. They play a key role in storing and transmitting genetic information."
What is the role of ATP in cells?,"ATP (adenosine triphosphate) acts as the primary energy currency in cells, providing energy for various biological processes."
How do polar and nonpolar molecules differ?,"Polar molecules have an unequal distribution of charge, leading to partial positive and negative regions. Nonpolar molecules have an equal distribution of charge, making them hydrophobic."
What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?,"Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus."
What is the function of the cell membrane?,"The cell membrane acts as a selectively permeable barrier, regulating the entry and exit of substances and maintaining the internal environment of the cell."
How do plant and animal cells differ?,"Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, while animal cells have centrioles and lysosomes."
What is the role of mitochondria in cells?,"Mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration, powering cellular activities."
What is the function of ribosomes in cells?,Ribosomes are responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into amino acid sequences.
