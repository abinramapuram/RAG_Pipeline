Question,Answer,Output
What are the main building blocks of life?,"The main building blocks of life are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These elements form carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids.","The elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus"
Why is water considered essential for life?,"Water is essential for life because it is a universal solvent, has high heat capacity, and provides a medium for chemical reactions. Its ability to form hydrogen bonds is critical for cellular functions.","Approximately 60–70 percent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist."
"What are macromolecules, and why are they important?","Macromolecules are large molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, that are essential for life. They serve as energy sources, structural components, and functional molecules for biological processes.","organic molecules are called biological macromolecules. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions."
How do ionic bonds form?,"Ionic bonds form when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions that are attracted to each other.","When an element donates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The element accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions stay together and form an ionic bond, or a bond between ions."
What is the role of enzymes in biological systems?,Enzymes act as biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for reactions to occur.,"break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new bonds"
What are the properties of water that make it unique?,"Water has unique properties such as cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, and the ability to dissolve many substances, making it essential for life.","Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive (+) and slightly negative (–) charges of polar covalent molecules, such as water."
What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?,"Saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms, making them solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds, making them liquid at room temperature.",saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature
"What are nucleotides, and why are they important?","Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. They play a key role in storing and transmitting genetic information.",DNA and RNA are made up of monomers
What is the role of ATP in cells?,"ATP (adenosine triphosphate) acts as the primary energy currency in cells, providing energy for various biological processes.",to create and maintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides of their membranes
How do polar and nonpolar molecules differ?,"Polar molecules have an unequal distribution of charge, leading to partial positive and negative regions. Nonpolar molecules have an equal distribution of charge, making them hydrophobic.",Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally
What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?,"Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus.","A prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane- bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes."
What is the function of the cell membrane?,"The cell membrane acts as a selectively permeable barrier, regulating the entry and exit of substances and maintaining the internal environment of the cell.","regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and water"
How do plant and animal cells differ?,"Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, while animal cells have centrioles and lysosomes.","Plant cells have centrioles, centrosomes (discussed under the cytoskeleton), and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not"
What is the role of mitochondria in cells?,"Mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration, powering cellular activities.",cellular respiration
What is the function of ribosomes in cells?,Ribosomes are responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into amino acid sequences.,They perform protein synthesis
